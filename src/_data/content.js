He said that itr violated the "equal time rule", blissfully ignoring the fact that NBC gave free time to Trump before a NASCAR race to present an election ad. He has also sent threatening letters to all the major social media platforms accusing them of "censorship" because they utilized a fact-checking service to review statements made by ALL of the candidates. His interpretation of "censorship" flies in the face of the accepted law on the freedom to express ones opinion. His attack on the expression of opinions that he does not agree with is antithetical to the underpinnings of our government and democracy. Even though he is wrong about the law (even the Federalist Society says he is wrong), his threats are an attempt to coerce these platforms to self-censor in an attempt to avoid his wrath (in the form of litigation as a form of harassment).',
